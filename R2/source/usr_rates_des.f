!  Purpose: Hook for user defined reaction rates.                      !
!                                                                      !

!  Comments: Write reaction rates in amount of chemical substance      !
!  per time. For CGS this has units mol/s. For _MFIX_ SI this has      !
!  units kmol/s.                                                       !
!                                                                      !
!  WARNING: Only discrete phase reactions should be specifed here.     !
!  Homogeneous gas phase reactions in DEM simulations must be given    !
!  in the continuum reaction hook (usr_rates.f).                       !
!                                                                      !
!  The call to usr_rates_des is made from inside a particle loop which !
!  is nested inside an IJK loop. Fluid grid calculations independent   !
!  of particle properties can be carried out in des/usr4_des.f to      !
!  reduce redundant calculations.                                      !
!                                                                      !
